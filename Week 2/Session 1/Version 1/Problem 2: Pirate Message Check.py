Taken captive, Captain Anne Bonny has been smuggled a secret message from her crew. She will know she can trust the message if it contains all of the letters in the alphabet. Given a string message containing only lowercase English letters and whitespace, write a function can_trust_message() that returns True if the message contains every letter of the English alphabet at least once, and False otherwise.

def can_trust_message(message):
    pass
Example Usage:

message1 = "sphinx of black quartz judge my vow"
message2 = "trust me"

print(can_trust_message(message1))
print(can_trust_message(message2))
Example Output:

True
False
